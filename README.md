# Cercul Feminin Platform

## Connecting Rural Romanian Artisans with Markets and Tourists

![Cercul Feminin]

## About the Project
Cercul Feminin is an AI-powered platform that bridges the gap between talented rural Romanian women artisans and broader markets. Our mission is to tackle the limited market access and logistical isolation faced by these artisans, where there is significant opportunity with 83% rural internet penetration but limited transportation infrastructure and e-commerce connections.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Connects artisans' handcrafted products with appropriate logistics providers and major Romanian e-commerce platforms like eMAG, FashionDays, and Elefant.ro

- **Via Transilvanica Integration**: Uniquely leverages the 1,420 km Via Transilvanica trail by connecting tourists with nearby artisans, showcasing locally produced goods available for immediate purchase or later delivery

- **Dual Market Access**: Provides artisans with both digital marketplace presence and direct tourist engagement, creating a powerful marketing engine through tourist social media sharing

- **Preservation of Cultural Heritage**: Promotes traditional Romanian crafts including carpets, baskets, ceramics, and other handmade goods while supporting sustainable practices in underserved communities

## Impact

Our initial testing with 15 women artisans along a 50km stretch of Via Transilvanica demonstrated:

- Average income increase of â‚¬150 per artisan during the 3-month testing period
- 20% increase in website traffic to linked e-commerce platform pages
- Organic social media reach to 2,500+ users through tourist sharing

## Technology

Built with React, the platform features responsive design, interactive maps for locating artisans along Via Transilvanica, comprehensive product listings, and detailed artisan profiles that tell the stories behind the crafts.
